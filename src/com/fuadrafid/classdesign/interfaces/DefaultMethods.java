/**
 A default method within an interface defines an abstract method with a default implementation.
 In this manner, classes have the option to override the default method if they
 need to, but they are not required to do so. If the class doesnâ€™t override the method, the
 default implementation will be used. In this manner, the method definition is concrete, not
 abstract.

 1. A default method may only be declared within an interface and not within a class or
 abstract class.

 2. A default method must be marked with the default keyword. If a method is marked as
 default , it must provide a method body.

 3. A default method is not assumed to be static , final , or abstract , as it may be used
 or overridden by a class that implements the interface.

 4. Like all methods in an interface, a default method is assumed to be public and will not
 compile if marked as private or protected .

/**
 The purpose of adding default methods to the Java language was in part to help with
 code development and backward compatibility. Imagine you have an interface that is
 shared among dozens or even hundreds of users that you would like to add a new method
 to. If you just update the interface with the new method, the implementation would break
 among all of your subscribers, who would then be forced to update their code. In practice,
 this might even discourage you from making the change altogether. By providing a default
 implementation of the method, though, the interface becomes backward compatible with
 the existing codebase, while still providing those individuals who do want to use the new
 method with the option to override it
