There are two inheritance rules you should keep in mind when extending an interface:
1. An interface that extends another interface, as well as an abstract class that
implements an interface, inherits all of the abstract methods as its own abstract
methods.
2. The first concrete class that implements an interface, or extends an abstract class
that implements an interface, must provide an implementation for all of the inherited
abstract methods.
